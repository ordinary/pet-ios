# This is Drop-in menu bar.

Download the tarball, drag the LightMenuBar folder into your project. 
The LightMenuBar is subclass of UIView and I am sure you know how to deal with it. 
Implement the three required methods in the LightMenuBarDelegate and you have this menu bar in your App.

Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/pppoe/LightMenuBar/wiki) for Sample Code.
